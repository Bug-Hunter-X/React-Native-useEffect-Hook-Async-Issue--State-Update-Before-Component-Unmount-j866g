# React Native useEffect Hook Async Issue: State Update Before Component Unmount

This repository demonstrates a common yet easily overlooked issue in React Native development involving the asynchronous nature of the `useEffect` hook and how it interacts with state updates.  The problem arises when a component unmounts before an asynchronous operation (like an API call) within `useEffect` completes. This can result in the component attempting to access or update state that hasn't been properly populated, leading to unexpected behavior or crashes.

## The Problem

The provided `bug.js` file contains a component that fetches data from an API using `useEffect`.  If the component unmounts (e.g., due to navigation) before the API call finishes, the state update might not happen, resulting in undefined behavior.

## The Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file presents a solution using the `AbortController` to handle the scenario where the component unmounts during the asynchronous operation.  This prevents unnecessary updates after the component has unmounted. This ensures more reliable and stable app behavior.
